# Inversion Sim v2 🌌

A real-time, browser-based mathematical visualizer that bridges square-table billiard dynamics, topological constants, the Ruliad web, and the Riemann Zeta function.

## Overview
Inversion Sim v2 is an exploratory physics and math engine. It simulates particle trajectories within a perfect 500x500 bounding box to differentiate between **Rational Closed Orbits** (perfect corner hits) and **Irrational Chaos Voids** (infinite winding paths). As the simulation runs, autonomous AI agents (Smiths and Blades) use gradient descent to hunt for specific topological constants and map them to emergent visualizations.

## Key Features

* **EYES (Physics Engine):** Simulates path winding. Inject a rational number (like `0.3333`) to watch geometric closed periodic orbits form. Inject an irrational constant (like `3.14159`) to witness infinite non-repeating chaos voids.
* **BRAIN (Ruliad Web):** Real-time mapping of Melli Spirals and Farey Spreads. An emergent cyan "Ruliad Thread" connects recent discoveries, complete with a Picture-in-Picture (PiP) replay monitor.
* **HANDS (Harmonics):** A live structural frequency spectrum tracking the diagnostic memory and efficiency of the active hunting bots.
* **HYPER (Torus Projection):** Maps the 2D ghost trajectories onto a rotating 3D Hyperbolic Torus. 
* **ZETA (Fractal Hunt):** Background agents constantly calculate the Riemann Zeta function along the $Re(s) = 1/2$ critical line. When a valid Zero is mathematically locked, it instantly syncs to the Hyper Torus as a pulsing gold ring, and the bot "hyperspace jumps" to a new sector.
* **ANALYZE (Topological Scanner):** Scans engine memory to match paths against known mathematical constants including $\pi, e, \phi$, Feigenbaum's constant ($\alpha$), and Apéry's constant ($\zeta(3)$).
